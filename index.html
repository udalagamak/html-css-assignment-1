                    <p>Chester Bennington became interested in music from an early age, having as inspiration Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots. 
                        He always dreamed of becoming a member of the Stone Temple Pilots. His parents separated when he was 9 years old, so he went into the custody of his father. 
                        The separation of his parents affected him so much that he fell into the use of marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, and LSD. Fortunately, after a while, he managed to 
                        overcome those addictions.</p>

                    <p>In 1993, he joined as a vocalist the local rock band called Gray Daze, where he managed to get more musical recognition; 
                        However, he left the band in 1998 due to creative differences with the members of the group. 
                        Sometime later, Chester Bennington met Jeff Blue, vice president of Zomba Music; who told the young man about the auditions to be a member of the band, Linkin Park.</p>

                    <p>For the year 1999, he moved to Los Angeles, to try to enter Xero (Name of the band at that time). At his audition, Chester quickly attracted the attention of 
                        the band for his vocal quality, so he was accepted as a vocalist.</p>
                            
                    <p>After his arrival to the band, this changed name to Hybrid Theory and later of the independent way the first work that realized was Hybrid Theory (EP), 
                        of which only one thousand copies were made. Later, the band changed its name to Lincoln Park, a name suggested by Chester, but due to an Internet domain 
                        that already had the name, they were renamed, Linkin Park.</p>

                    <p>In 1999, Chester Bennington and the band signed with the label Warner Bros. 
                        Records and in 2000 they released their first studio album entitled “Hybrid Theory” which until now is their most impactful album, since that time, Chester and the 
                        band published the recordings: Meteora (2003), Minutes to Midnight (2007), A Thousand Suns (2010), Living Things (2012), The Hunting Party (2014), and One More Light (2017) ), 
                        also worked on the Collision Course album with Jay-Z.</p>

                    <p>In 2002, they started their Projekt Revolution tour taking it to different stages in different years throughout his career.</p>

                    <p>Chester Bennington died on July 20, 2017, at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California, because of a hanging. 
                        The singer had fallen again in problems of drug addiction and alcoholism, which added to personal problems of his past may have influenced suicide.
